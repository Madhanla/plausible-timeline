In the beginning there was nothing.
Then came the Big Bang, and nothingness became unnothingness.
Let's be more precise.
Time began on 1 January 1970.
It is a common misconception that man had landed on moon.
Time didn't exist yet.
False memories were put into people's minds.
But the clock doesn't lie.
And it starts in 1970.
