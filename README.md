This repository  contains a plaussible  history of everything.   It is
intended as a showcase of an alternative fun way to use git. It is not
intended to be a rigorous historical source, so don't trust it.

This repository will receive forced pushes, so merges won't work well.
See my other repository 'gistory' if you want to see older versions.
