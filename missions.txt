== Extinction of the species ==
This mission is proceeding as expected.
On 8 September last year, the last dinosaur died.
The last of a long list of victories.
Long live the bees!

The bird's king was deposed.
And a new despot took charge.
New nets get mass traction.
Will they trap the bird to death?

== Confrontations ==
Further success. New commandment added was:
"Thou shalt hate the other side
in the land of condor where no one lies".
Clearly that's how you end a war.
